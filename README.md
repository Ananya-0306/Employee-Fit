WFH Effect on Mental health

## Inspiration
We are a group of students who have experienced the transition from working offline to going completely remote. From meeting our colleagues everyday in-person, we could now only meet them on video calls. To say that we lost some motivation to work would be an understatement, we went through many mental and physical changes. While on the other hand, there were people who found this a blessing in disguise! This made us realize that there are many factors that affect the employee’s choice to work from home or office and this choice is proportional to the employee’s productivity. Mental Health plays an important role which affects the employee’s productivity and we want to help companies support the Mental Health of their employees by giving them a tool to help decide which employees would have positive mental health from working at home or working from office.
